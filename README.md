# FractalVisualizations
You can adjust the pixel size in mandelbrotSet.py to view the Mandelbrot set with varying degrees of clarity\
You can adjust the x and y scales in barnsleyFern.py to change the shape of the fractal\
There is also a mutation of the Bernsley fern contained in barnsleyFern.py which shows how adjusting the probability 
and coefficients affects the shape and behaviour of the fractal
